# RISC-V Central Processing Unit

## Description

This is my design and implementation of a two-pipelined CPU for the RISC-V instruction set architecture using digital logic circuits simulated in Logisim. This CPU is capable of converting RISC-V assembly code into runnable machine code. I implemented multiple essential components including an arithmetic logic unit (ALU), a control unit, and memory hierarchy. Additionally, pipelining and control hazards are addressed through forwarding and stall mechanisms for correct instruction execution at each time step.

## Design 

This CPU utilizes basic logic circuits and a ROM input to translate RISC-V assembly code into binary.

## Instructions for Use

TODO

## Collaborators

This project was completed with my partner, Daisy Polanco, as part of UC Berkeley's Computer Architecture and Machine Structures course.
